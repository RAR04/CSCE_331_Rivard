                O.R. Simpson Honor Society is one of the premier service organizations in the Corps of Cadets.
                Members give up their time to tutor other cadets to try and raise grades across the Corps, with members required to tutor over 8 hours every semester.
                The collective experience of all the members, along with years of graded tests from nearly every course in the university,
                allow cadets to be supported in every academic endeavour.
                Those in the unit can be recodnized by the distinctive blue and white cord worn on their left shoulder.

                    The Big Event is a yearly service project in the Bryan-College Station area, where members
                    of Texas A&M University help members of the community in need. The organization manages requests
                    and matching the right people to the right job. Thousands of Aggies put out to give back to the community
                    that supports the college by giving up 2-4 hours on a Saturday to engage in manual labor.
