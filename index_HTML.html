                <p>
                    I am a junior Computer Science major, with minors in Cybersecurity and Mathematics, and a U.S. Army contract. After graduation, I will commission into the U.S. Army as a 2nd Lieutenant and hopefully
                     earn a cyber billet as either a 17A or 17D officer. I am a bass player in the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band <em><i>(WHOOP!)</i></em>
                    and a member of the A-Company Wolfpack, one of the six units comprising the Aggie Band. As a member of A-Company, I serve as a scholastics 
                    and career readiness sergeant. I serve as leadership in the Corps Cyber Operations Special Unit, which teaches its members from the very basics of a 
                    Linux terminal to advanced topics such as shell scripting, reverse engineering, and remote exploits. I have recently joined O.R. Simpson Honor Society, 
                    which is an academic support organization for the Corps of Cadets. Members tutor anyone in the Corps that requests it. 
                    I am a member of Cyber Leader Development Program, a Department of Defense sponsored and funded program 
                    hosted at each of the six senior military colleges that prepares its members to serve our nation in either a civilian or military capacity within cyberspace. 
                    I have previously competed in <i>NSA</i> Codebreakers, a Capture The Flag (CTF) style of challenge, which aims to help the NSA find those that are capable, 
                    while also giving people across the country to train cybersecurity skills. I have also competed in <i>NSA</i> Cyber Exercise (NCX), a multi-day competition 
                    between the military academies and senior military colleges. NCX covers a broad spectrum of cybersecurity skills culminating with a live-fire exercise, 
                    where teams must attack and defend servers. The competition has recently moved to a hybrid model, 
                    allowing teams to compete remotely by hosting everything over a secured web server, rather than a local network system. This method also ensures that a team can't 
                    fork bomb the infrastructure to prevent other teams from outscoring them, as each team has a separately simulated environment.
