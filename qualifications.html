                    I am proficient at programming in C++ and Python.<br>
                    I possess in-depth knowledge of Java and its Collections framework.<br>
                    I am competent with basic cybersecurity skills, to include knowledge of Linux and bash scripting.<br>

                    My primary area of interest in computer science is cybersecurity, as it is far removed from graphics 
                    and visual design which I generally tend to shy away from. I am in multiple organizations that push their members
                    to pursue cybersecurity training beyond Texas A&M's limited scope of cybersecurity courses.
