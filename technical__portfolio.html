                    <h2>A+ Computer Science</h2>
                    <p>I worked internships at A+ Computer Science developing tests on the Java programming language designed to prepare students
                        for the Texas UIL State programming competition. The tests range in difficultly, from basics of programming and Java syntax
                        to data structures and algorithms, graph theory, and niche Java semantics. I worked with other interns to edit and review the tests
                        that we all created. The first internship, I also helped test a new software solution that allows users to program directly in the company's website.

                    <h2>Bio ISAC</h2>
                    <p>While I didn't work directly for Bio ISAC, I co-developed an introductory biology, genetics, genomics, and cybersecurity
                        ciriculum to help Bio ISAC's mission of securing the bioeconomy. I worked through creating and managing virtual machines
                        that enable students of the course to gain an apprieciable understanding of several facets of cybersecurity, and computer software
                        that is likely to be encountered within the bioeconomy. I also helped the other interns develop the presentations for all of the curriculum.
